A thread is unit of operation that our cpu has to perform for us.

In thread something called event loop is generated.

The role of the event loop is to schedule which operations
our only thread has to perform at any given point.


In simple words, event loops is a mechanism take callbacks
and register them and when that process is completed they call them back.

Event loop runs automatically.
